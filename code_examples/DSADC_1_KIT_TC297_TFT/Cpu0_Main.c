 /*\title Delta-Sigma ADC conversion
 * \abstract The DSADC is used to convert an external signal to a stream of discrete digital values.
 * \description The Delta-Sigma ADC (DSADC) continuously measures an external signal on channel 0, connected
 *              to port pin AN2. It converts the analog signal to a data stream and then a global variable is updated
 *              to the current conversion result.
